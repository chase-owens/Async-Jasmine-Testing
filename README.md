# Project Overview

In this project, I was given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and I was left with an application with an incomplete test suite.

For this project, I built test suites and and tests to ensure the Feed Reader was performing as expected.

## What did I learn?

I got experience with Jasmine writing a number of tests against a pre-existing application. These test the underlying business logic of the application as well as the event handling and DOM manipulation.

## Instructions to view

To run and view the application, download the zip file and open the index.html file.

Thanks for looking.
